# Pizza Shop

#### This is my fourth individual project. I create a webpage for a pizza shop. Customers can order pizza with different toppings.

#### By Mohamed Warsame

## Description

On this website I created a user can order pizza. The pizza has 3 different sizes and many toppings. Users pick one size and then they can choose as many toppings as they want.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* I started with empty page
* Then I downloaded jQuery and Bootsrtap
* Create well defined specs
* Then I created my code using HTML, CSS, Bootsrtap, JavaScript and jQuery
* I also used a special font that I got from Google which I linked
* I committed throughout


## Known Bugs

One bug is a user is not required to select a size. I didn't have time to fix that.

## Specs

| Behavior | input | output |
